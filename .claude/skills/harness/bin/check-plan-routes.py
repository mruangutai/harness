"""check-plan-routes.py — plan-time route check (D-01).

Answers, while a PLAN.md is still being written, whether every task's `files:`
paths land on an agent granted to write them, or are honestly declared
`execution_mode: main-session-direct`. It is a PLAN-PHASE CLI, not a
PreToolUse hook — see D-01 for why this is a new script rather than a mode of
check-state.sh or an invariant of check-domain.sh.

ROUTING IS NEVER RE-IMPLEMENTED HERE (D-02, SC-08): every path is resolved by
shelling out to `check-domain.sh --resolve <path>` with stdin closed. This
file must never gain its own copy of Python's stdlib pattern matcher, its own
glob-to-regex translator, or a bare prefix comparison — a prefix comparison
on the text before `/**` answers False for a pattern with an earlier
wildcard segment (e.g. `.harness/features/*/runs/*-eng/**`), which is the
exact bug check-domain.sh:190-197 records fixing.

Task blocks are found with the SAME regex check-state.sh uses (D-08), copied
rather than shared because check-state.sh belongs to the in-flight FEAT-08 and
PLAN.md is markdown, not YAML.
