## Gotchas (max 15)
- G-01: Nothing invokes check-state.sh automatically — it is manual-only, so a green session is not evidence it ran. (This gotcha used to also cover check-docs.sh's exec-bit fail-open; that script and INV-10 were struck under DEC-188.)
- G-02: `.claude/skills/harness/templates/harness.json` is merged additively into `.harness/harness.json` by `.claude/skills/harness/bin/upgrade-config.py`, and copied verbatim on init — editing one without the other creates silent drift on the next upgrade or init.
